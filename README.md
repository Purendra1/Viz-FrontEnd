# Viz FrontEnd
Pre-requisites:
Python (v3.6.x and above) and a web browser with JavaScript support
Also you need to run and enable the backend API as mentioned in here - https://github.com/Purendra1/PhotoGalleryApp2.git

To run the Front End you will require a server. It would be so much better if you can host it over Apache. If you are not using apache then make a simple http server by navigating to:
    `./public_html`
    
Then type the following command:
    
    `python -m http.server 8080`
    
Open localhost:8080 in a web browser.
